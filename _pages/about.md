Hi! I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University. My research interest includes computer vision and vision language model.

I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zuxuan Wu](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan Vision and Learning Lab(FVL)](https://fvl.fudan.edu.cn/).

I'm currently looking for PhD opportunities. If you are interested in me, feel free to [email](kxfan21@m.fudan.edu.cn) me!
